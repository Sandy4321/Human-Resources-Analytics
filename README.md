## Introduction
Human Resources Analytics is an interesting dataset from Kaggle to explore. Our goal is trying to understand why our best and most experienced employees are leaving the company prematurely. We have this database with ten variables and ten thousand observations. Our challege consists in guessing the reasons behind their leaving and to predict which valuable employees will leave next.
